                    I am a full-stack web developer with experience in HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, Ruby, Rails, and React 
                    (pst... this site was built on React and Rails!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated from New York University with a degree in Experiential Technology. 
                    After working in project management at startups, I pivoted to web development 
                    so that I could dig my hands in and solve product puzzles myself.

                    In my spare time, I sing along to musical theater soundtracks and work on whatever DIY craft
                    the season calls for. (At the moment, that's converting my cargo trailer, Iris, into a camper van.)
                </p>
